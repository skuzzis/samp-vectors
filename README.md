## Why SA:MP Vectors and what is it?

SA:MP Vectors are vectors from C++ adapted to PAWN. It's more like YSI Iterators, but with more speed and very flexible. SA:MP Vectors contains a lot of useful features, including an Foreach to go trought all elements of it.

## When was made SA:MP Vectors and what was the reason of developing it?

SA:MP Vectors were started on 10th June 2021 and the first release was made on 14th June 2021. It has been developed in 2 full days and then only bug fixes. The reason of developing it was to improve the efficiency of YSI's Iterators, to make them faster and efficient in my opinion.

## By who was made this project?

This project was made by Andrei "SkuZZi" Sebastian, which lives in Romania and it's 16 years old.
